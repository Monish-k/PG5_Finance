<h4><strong><em>Project Gladiator Group 5 : Finance - EMI virtual card management</em></strong><h/4>
<hr>
<p>Small scale finance application to provide customers with virtual credit card, where they can use it as a payment mode.</p>
<p>The current market only offers credit card and usage for those who have good cibil score. But for a regular customers this could be a roadblock, especially if he new user. We solve this issue by providing them witha virtual card after the document verification and also the user can choose between different cards which have different card limits.</p>
<p>The best about the application is, it truly offers <strong><em>No Cost EMI</em></strong>, only cost inccured by the end user is card selection for document approval.</p>
